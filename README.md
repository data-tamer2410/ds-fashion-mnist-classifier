# Fashion MNIST Classifier
A Fashion MNIST image classification project using a neural network built with Keras and hyperparameter optimization with Optuna.

## Description
This project tackles the task of classifying images of clothing from the Fashion MNIST dataset, using a neural network built with Keras. The architecture and hyperparameters, including the number of layers, activation function, and batch size, were optimized with Optuna. The model achieved strong performance, reaching 93.24% accuracy on training data and 88.3% on the test dataset.
